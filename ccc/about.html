                    <h1>We believe</h1>
                    <p>Here at Community we say that becoming a follower of Christ is “a decision that is followed by a process.”  We make a decision to accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior and then begin the process of changing our lives to become more and more like Him.  It is this process of continually growing to become like Christ that is often confusing for new followers of Christ.  Even if you haven’t accepted Christ yet, you can participate in the journey to discover the good things God has in store for his followers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Becoming a fully devoted follower of Christ is a lifetime spiritual journey that is taken one step at a time.  The following graphic will serve as a road map to help you understand some of the steps that you should take as your begin Your Spiritual Journey at Community.  
                      </p>             
                      <p>
                      We believe that every Christian striving to become like Christ and grow in their relationship with Him, should be involved in 3 distinct environments – a Worship environment, a Serve environment, and a Grow environment.  Only through our involvement in all 3 environments will we experience the exciting adventure of a life fully devoted to Christ.  It is in this Worship environment where we encounter God and are encouraged and challenged to grow in our relationship with Him.
                      </p>
              <h1>Grow Environment</h1>
                    <p>We are encouraged in the Bible to continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of Christ.  We believe that every Christ follower does that best in Small Groups, our Grow environment.  In a small group setting, you will study the Bible in an environment where you can ask questions, participate in a discussion and hear others share insights and illustrations of the truth you are trying to grasp.  Small groups at Community are called communityGroups and meet both on our campus and in homes throughout South Florida and typically meet weekly or every other week.  As you gain knowledge and tools at Church, you will be equipped to build your relationship with the Lord on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>
                    
                    To make it easy for you to move from the Worship environment to a Grow environment, we have created Dinner Groups and A Taste of Community as a bridge to help you build relationships and begin to experience the benefits of being involved in a small group.</p>
