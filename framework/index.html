       Welcome to the online home of Community Christian Church. We believe that all people matter to God and therefore they matter to us. Because of this, our doors are open to people from all backgrounds regardless of where they are on their spiritual journey. At Community we are striving to become the kind of church described in the Bible, where there is relevant teaching, heart-felt worship, honest friendships, consistent prayer, and compassionate care for those who are in need. In short, we would like to have the kind of contagious Christianity that can influence and encourage our entire community, one life at a time.

So whether you are a spiritual seeker who's just starting to ask questions about God or a committed Christian who wants to sink the roots of your faith even deeper, you can find a home here at Community Christian Church. You'll find that this is a place where you really do matter to us because you matter to God.

Scott Eynon
Senior Pastor
