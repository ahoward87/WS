    Our Children’s Ministry serves kids from birth through 5th grade and is affectionately named “CommunityKIDZ”.  We are a “community” where kids have a great time learning Bible truths.  Whave worked hard to provide a fun and safe environment that is Kid Tested and Mother Approved!  Our goal is that CommunityKIDZ would become the best part of your child’s week.  We do this by incorporating a three-part vision for our ministry:<ul>
      <p>	<li><div class="list">	Laughing </div> – Kids learn best when they are having fun. They also want to come back again and again.  Everything we do has an element of fun added so that it appeals to kids. </li>
        
      <p><li> <div class="list"> Learning </div>– We want to make the Bible come to life for kids.  We believe the Bible is not an ancient book that needs dusting once a week.  We believe it provides practical advice for everyday living – even for kids.  We use video, music, lights, drama, puppets, games and art to make the Bible very real to the kids at Community Christian Church.</li>
      <p> <li> <div class="list"> Life-Changing </div> – The goal of the Bible is for us to experience Life Change.  We believe that life change can happen to even the smallest members of a family.  In addition, we provide on a weekly basis materials for our families which encourage our families to sit down and experience life change together.</li></ul>
       <p>Safety is a priority at CommunityKIDZ.  Our volunteers are background screened through Protect My Ministry and committed to ensuring your child’s safety.  In addition, we use a security system for check-in.  This system allows us to silently page parents in service, should your child need you.
        
        
        
       We look forward to meeting your KIDZ!                        </section>
