Connecting with others is easy to say, but sometimes more daunting to actually apply.  But don't we all want to be a part of something...to be known?  Here at Community, we want to make connecting a reality.  We've created steps and environments that will help you do just that...CONNECT!  
</p>
      <p>Our desire is to see you begin your spiritual journey at Starting Point, an informal luncheon where you will meet the ministry staff and others new to Community.  Visit the Starting Point page to find out more information, including the date for our next luncheon. 
      </p>
      <p>After attending Starting Point, your next step would be to attend our Discovery Classes, beginning with 101: Discovering Community.  Our 101 class will answer your questions and continue to lead you along your spiritual path, inspiring, teaching and motivating you along the way to become a fully devoted follower of Christ.  The Discovery Classes page will show you the complete listing of our Discovery Classes including dates for upcoming classes.</p>
      <p> The easiest way to begin connecting with the people of Community is through Bridge Environments.  These environments exist to help you connect to small groups or places of service.
      </p>
      <p>Through these opportunities we trust that you'll begin relationships with others, see spiritual growth and find yourself in a "sweet spot" of service.</p>
